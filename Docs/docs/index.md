features:
  - title: Characterization Workflow
    details: Provide a fixed vehicle configuration. The solver computes steady-state and transient performance metrics from first principles. No empirical lookup tables.

  - title: DOE Workflow
    details: Define parameters to sweep. The solver runs batch simulations and returns sensitivities and partial derivatives across the design space.

  - title: First-Principles Foundation
    details: Every metric traces directly to physical equations of motion. The same framework applies to simulation, physical testing, and vehicle design in parallel.
