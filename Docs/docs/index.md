# BobDyn

BobDyn is a reference framework for defining, interpreting, and evaluating vehicle behavior using first-principles vehicle dynamics. The emphasis is on physically meaningful descriptions of vehicle response, independent of any specific test procedure, competition rule set, or prescriptive design target.

This site documents a canonical set of vehicle performance metrics used to describe handling, stability, and dynamic response. These metrics are intended to form a common technical language that bridges simulation, physical testing, and vehicle design workflows.

## Design Philosophy

Rather than prescribing what a vehicle *should* be optimized for, BobDyn defines what a vehicle *does* physically. Each metric is grounded in vehicle dynamics theory and describes an observable aspect of system behavior.

The relative importance of any metric is intentionally left unspecified. Weighting and prioritization depend on the intended application, operating environment, and design objectives of a given team or program.

By separating physical behavior from prioritization, the same framework can be applied to motorsport, production vehicles, research programs, or education without modification.

## What This Site Contains

- Conceptual definitions of vehicle performance metrics and the physical behaviors they represent
- Explanations of why these metrics are commonly used to evaluate vehicle handling, stability, and dynamic response
- A consistent vocabulary for discussing steady-state, transient, and frequency-domain vehicle behavior

## What This Site Does Not Do

- Prescribe numerical targets or design requirements
- Rank metrics by importance or assign weights
- Recommend specific test standards or procedures
- Provide tuning rules, control strategies, or optimization guidance

<p class="closing-note">
The intent of BobDyn is to provide a clear, physics-based foundation upon which application-specific decisions can be made using objective, reproducible metrics.
