# Workflows

BobDyn supports two primary analysis workflows. Both operate on the same underlying vehicle model
and physics layer — they differ in how inputs are specified and what the outputs represent.

## Characterization

A single, fixed vehicle configuration is provided as input. The solver runs once and returns a
complete set of performance metrics describing how that vehicle behaves physically.

Use this workflow to:

- Evaluate a specific vehicle setup
- Establish a performance baseline before making changes
- Compute metric values to compare against a previous configuration

## Design of Experiments

A set of parameters is provided along with defined ranges and step sizes. The solver runs across the
full parameter space and returns sensitivity data — how much each input parameter influences each
output metric, and in what direction.

Use this workflow to:

- Identify which parameters have the most influence on a target metric
- Quantify trade-offs between competing objectives
- Prioritize development effort based on partial derivatives

## How They Relate

Characterization answers: *what does this vehicle do?*

DOE answers: *what happens if I change this parameter?*

A typical workflow runs characterization first to establish the current state, then uses DOE to
understand the sensitivity of the design space around that state.
